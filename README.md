A comprehensive, high-performance graph algorithms library for Swift, inspired by the Boost Graph Library. Swift Graphs provides flexible graph representations with a small core API and extensive algorithm coverage, designed for maximum performance and type safety. The library is platform-independent and runs on all Swift-supported platforms including iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS.

## üîå **Pluggable Architecture**

Swift Graphs is built around a powerful plugin architecture where **storage backends**, **property systems**, and **algorithms** are completely pluggable and interchangeable. This design allows you to:

- **Mix and match storage strategies** - Use adjacency lists for sparse graphs, matrices for dense graphs, or custom storage backends
- **Extend property systems** - Add custom vertex/edge properties or use computed properties
- **Swap algorithms** - Choose the best algorithm for your specific use case or implement custom ones
- **Compose graph types** - Combine different capabilities to create specialized graph implementations

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Add Swift Graphs to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/tevelee/swift-graphs.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Basic Usage

```swift
import Graphs

// Create a simple graph
var graph = AdjacencyList()
graph.add(edges: [
    ("s", "a"),
    ("s", "b"),
    ("a", "c"),
    ("b", "d"),
])

// Find shortest path
let path = graph.shortestPath(from: "s", to: "c", using: .dijkstra())
print("Shortest path: \(path?.vertices)")
// Output: Shortest path: ["s", "a", "c"]
```

### Graph Traversal

```swift
// Depth-first search
let dfsResult = graph.traverse(from: "s", using: .dfs())
print("DFS vertices: \(dfsResult.vertices)")

// Breadth-first search
let bfsResult = graph.traverse(from: "s", using: .bfs())
print("BFS vertices: \(bfsResult.vertices)")
```

### Grid Graph Pathfinding

```swift
// Create a 10x10 grid
let grid = GridGraph(width: 10, height: 10)

// Find path using A* with Manhattan distance
let start = GridGraph.Vertex(x: 0, y: 0)
let goal = GridGraph.Vertex(x: 9, y: 9)

let path = grid.shortestPath(
    from: start, 
    to: goal, 
    using: .aStar(heuristic: .manhattanDistance)
)
```

## üìö Advanced Examples

### Custom Graph Properties

One of the most powerful features is the ability to add custom properties to graphs. Here's how I can extend graphs with domain-specific properties:

```swift
// Define a custom property for social network analysis
struct SocialMetrics: GraphProperty {
    var influenceScore: Double
    var communityId: Int
    var isInfluencer: Bool { influenceScore > 0.8 }
}

// Create a graph with custom properties
var socialGraph = AdjacencyList()

// Add vertices with social metrics
let alice = socialGraph.addVertex { $0.influenceScore = 0.9; $0.communityId = 1 }
let bob = socialGraph.addVertex { $0.influenceScore = 0.3; $0.communityId = 1 }
let charlie = socialGraph.addVertex { $0.influenceScore = 0.7; $0.communityId = 2 }

// Add weighted connections
socialGraph.addEdge(from: alice, to: bob) { $0.weight = 0.8 }
socialGraph.addEdge(from: alice, to: charlie) { $0.weight = 0.6 }

// Query using custom properties
let influencers = socialGraph.vertices.filter { socialGraph[$0].isInfluencer }
print("Influencers: \(influencers.map { socialGraph[$0].influenceScore })")
```

### Pluggable Storage Backends

I can easily swap storage backends based on graph characteristics:

```swift
// For sparse graphs - use adjacency list
var sparseGraph = AdjacencyList()
sparseGraph.add(edges: [("a", "b"), ("b", "c")])

// For dense graphs - use adjacency matrix
var denseGraph = AdjacencyMatrix()
denseGraph.add(edges: [
    ("a", "b", 5), ("a", "c", 3), ("a", "d", 8),
    ("b", "c", 2), ("b", "d", 4), ("c", "d", 1)
])

// For memory-constrained scenarios - use lazy evaluation
let lazyGraph = LazyGraph { vertex in
    // Compute neighbors on-demand
    return computeNeighbors(for: vertex)
}
```

### Custom Algorithm Implementation

I can implement custom algorithms that leverage the pluggable architecture:

```swift
// Custom algorithm for finding influential nodes
struct InfluenceRanking<Node, Edge>: GraphAlgorithm {
    func findInfluencers(in graph: some GraphComponent<Node, Edge>) -> [Node] {
        // Custom implementation using graph properties
        return graph.vertices
            .sorted { 
                graph[$0].influenceScore > graph[$1].influenceScore 
            }
    }
}

// Use the custom algorithm
let ranking = InfluenceRanking()
let topInfluencers = ranking.findInfluencers(in: socialGraph)
```

### Graph Coloring with Different Strategies

```swift
// Create a complex graph
var graph = AdjacencyList()
graph.add(edges: [
    ("a", "b"), ("a", "c"), ("b", "d"), ("c", "d"), 
    ("d", "e"), ("e", "f"), ("f", "a")
])

// Try different coloring algorithms
let greedyColoring = graph.colorGraph(using: .greedy())
let dsaturColoring = graph.colorGraph(using: .dsatur())
let welshPowellColoring = graph.colorGraph(using: .welshPowell())

print("Greedy colors needed: \(greedyColoring.chromaticNumber)")
print("DSatur colors needed: \(dsaturColoring.chromaticNumber)")
print("Welsh-Powell colors needed: \(welshPowellColoring.chromaticNumber)")
```

### Minimum Spanning Tree with Different Algorithms

```swift
// Create a weighted graph
var weightedGraph = AdjacencyList()
weightedGraph.add(edges: [
    ("a", "b", 4.0), ("a", "c", 2.0), ("b", "c", 1.0),
    ("b", "d", 5.0), ("c", "d", 8.0), ("c", "e", 10.0),
    ("d", "e", 2.0), ("d", "f", 6.0), ("e", "f", 3.0)
])

// Compare different MST algorithms
let kruskalMST = weightedGraph.minimumSpanningTree(using: .kruskal())
let primMST = weightedGraph.minimumSpanningTree(using: .prim())
let boruvkaMST = weightedGraph.minimumSpanningTree(using: .boruvka())

print("Kruskal MST weight: \(kruskalMST.totalWeight)")
print("Prim MST weight: \(primMST.totalWeight)")
print("Bor≈Øvka MST weight: \(boruvkaMST.totalWeight)")
```

### Random Graph Generation

```swift
// Generate different types of random graphs
let erdosRenyi = ConnectedGraph.random(
    vertices: 100, 
    using: .erdosRenyi(edgeProbability: 0.1)
)

let barabasiAlbert = ConnectedGraph.random(
    vertices: 100,
    using: .barabasiAlbert(edgesPerVertex: 3)
)

let wattsStrogatz = ConnectedGraph.random(
    vertices: 100,
    using: .wattsStrogatz(neighbors: 4, rewiringProbability: 0.1)
)

// Analyze properties of generated graphs
print("ER graph is connected: \(erdosRenyi.isConnected)")
print("BA graph clustering: \(barabasiAlbert.clusteringCoefficient)")
print("WS graph small world: \(wattsStrogatz.hasSmallWorldProperty)")
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Swift Graphs follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Graph Definitions** - Core protocols and abstractions
- **Graph Implementations** - Concrete graph data structures  
- **Algorithm Definitions** - Algorithm interfaces and contracts
- **Algorithm Implementations** - Specific algorithm implementations
- **Utilities** - Helper types and common functionality

### Protocol-Based Design

The library uses Swift's protocol system to provide compile-time safety and enable the pluggable architecture:

```swift
// Only works with weighted graphs
extension Graph where Self: EdgePropertyGraph {
    func shortestPath<Weight: AdditiveArithmetic & Comparable>(
        from source: VertexDescriptor,
        to destination: VertexDescriptor,
        using algorithm: some ShortestPathAlgorithm<Self, Weight>
    ) -> Path<VertexDescriptor, EdgeDescriptor>?
}
```

## üìä Performance

Swift Graphs is designed for high performance:

- **Zero-cost abstractions** where possible
- **Efficient memory usage** with specialized storage backends
- **Optimized algorithms** with careful attention to complexity
- **Lazy evaluation** for memory-efficient large graph processing

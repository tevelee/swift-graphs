- Property-based testing

**Why Important:** Empowers advanced users to extend the library for their specific needs. Shows how the protocol-oriented design enables customization without forking.

### 4. **Troubleshooting & FAQ** (`Troubleshooting.md`) - ~500 lines
Practical solutions to common issues and frequently asked questions.

**Contents:**

**Common Compilation Errors:**
- Method unavailable errors (type constraints)
- Type conversion errors
- Hashable conformance issues

**Performance Issues:**
- Slow shortest path computation
- Traversal hangs
- Memory issues with large graphs

**Algorithm Issues:**

- Protocol composition

**FAQ (15+ questions):**
- Choosing between graph types
- Modifying graphs during traversal
- Handling disconnected graphs
- Weighted graph setup
- Graph visualization
- SwiftUI integration
- Very large graph handling
- Parallel execution
- Debugging techniques

**Why Important:** Saves users hours of debugging by providing solutions to common issues. Covers the practical "gotchas" that documentation often misses.
